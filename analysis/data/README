Hi Gail, Charles,
  attached is the trace data for Byrd.  The data is from line THW/SJB2/BB01a, and was flown on December 28, 2004 as part of the AGASEA project.
The .dat files (for incoherent, 1d and 2d focused SAR, high gain data) contain two columns - time in microseconds since trace recording started, and power seen by the radar on board the aircraft in dBm (10*(log (power in mWatts)).  No corrections for ice loss, spreading loss, or antenna patterns were added.  The aircraft was ~870 meters from the core site, traveling at 67 meters/second, and was 550 meters above the ground, with a slight -0.37 degree roll, traveling due east (bearing 078).  The surface echo is seen at 4.04 microseconds.  The trace is at about 1173.5 km in the attached depth corrected radargram.

The pikers have identified the following layers (time in microseconds of record):  The foc2 are the CDI layers; others were supported by Vetlesen.

6.02    lay2_ncd
6.775   lay1_kid
7.18    lay1_kmc
8.94    lay1_had
9.94902 lay1_jbd
9.94902 lay1_spc
9.94902 lay3_mrw_foc2
9.94902 lay4_emp_foc2
11.1    lay1_adj_foc2
11.1    lay4_spc
12.78   lay3_spc
13.02   lay2_mrw_foc2
18.92   lay1_mrw_foc2
19.0205 lay2_spc





Cheers,

Hi Duncan,

Vunderbar. Late night?

What is the formatting on the .dat files? They don't appear to be text files. Binary fortran?
