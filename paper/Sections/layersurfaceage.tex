Radar reflection layers are assumed isochronous, so dating them at one point along their extent makes it possible to know the age of the entire radar layer. Interpolation between flight lines then leads to an isochronous surface within the ice sheet. Due to the extent of radar coverage in central West Antarctica, we have traced
