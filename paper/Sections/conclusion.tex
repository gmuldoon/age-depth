We derive ages for isochronous radar reflectors observed near the Byrd ice core which includes estimates of uncertainty in ice flow parameters and ice properties in the region of Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica. Such radar observations may reveal englacial stratigraphy indicative of past ice flow, but require dating to put constraints on interpretations of ice dynamics. The Byrd ice core location connects WAIS Divide to the ice streams of the Siple Coast and the Marie Byrd Land icecap, but its chronology has lacked robust estimates of uncertainty until now. 

Our estimates of the reflector age-depth are confirmed by independent comparison to the same reflectors dated using the WAIS Divide ice core chronology \citep{buizert2015}. Our results indicate the oldest continuous radar reflector dateable using existing ice cores and radar surveys in West Antarctica is located at $\sim$70\% ice depth at the Byrd ice core site and dates to $\sim$ 25.67 $\pm$ 1.45 ka. The same reflector is observed at $~\sim$80\% ice depth in the WAIS Divide ice core. While the Byrd ice core has been dated to as old as $\sim$ 94 ka \citep{blunier2001}, continuous radar reflectors do not extend deep enough in this region to leverage the ice core to date older aspects of the ice geometry in the central WAIS. Further, the range precision of existing ice-penetrating radar systems is the biggest contributor to uncertainty in radar reflector age. This uncertainty is largely irreducible due to practical trade-offs in system design and leads to potentially significant uncertainty in reflector age at depth. 

This analysis also includes self-consistent estimates (with uncertainty) of local ice characteristics, such as the accumulation rate as a function of depth, the firn correction, and the velocity of EM waves in ice. These parameter estimates can be used to inform ice sheet modeling efforts in this region and for other studies of paleo ice flow through the LGM.
