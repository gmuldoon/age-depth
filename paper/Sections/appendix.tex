\section{Metropolis Evaluation}
\counterwithin{figure}{section} %reset figure numbering

The metropolis algorithm was evaluated for 450,000 iterations, with the first 10,000 discarded as ``burnin" iterations, during which the model was experiencing transient behavior. Such a large number of iterations allows for convergence of all parameters to their best solutions. Our method is based on a markov chain, such that the proposed parameter values for each iteration depend on the values from the last accepted iteration according to:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:proposal}
\begin{split}
delta&=Range(Prior) \\
Proposal_i&=Accepted_{i-1} + dp \cdot (0.5-rand) \cdot delta;
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $delta$ is the range allowed by the uniform prior for each parameter and $rand$ is a random number between 0 and 1. $Proposal_i$ is the value of a parameter for iteration $i$ and $Accepted_{i-1}$ is the previous value of that parameter accepted by the algorithm. To more efficiently explore parameter space, proposed parameters were selected with step sizes $dp_{Age}$ = 0.1 and $dp_{TWTT}$ = 0.1 for those parameters associated with each likelihood in Equation~\ref{eqn:bigproblem}.

The evaluation of the two likelihood functions (i.e. ``cost") are independently accepted according to each function's metropolis probability during each iteration. The accepted solutions for each cost, depth, and age are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cost}. As seen in the figure, these cost values show little trend aside from occasional positive departures from the mean as the model explores parameter space.

\section{Regularization}\label{sec:regularization}
\counterwithin{figure}{section} %reset figure numbering

Sampling accumulation rate parameters along the depth profile is inefficient and problematic because many proposed solutions are unrealistically variable. We expect the mean accumulation rate over time (and therefore depth) changes slowly and continuously. To improve our accumulation rate solutions, we regularize the likelihood of reflector age. A regularization parameter is added to the age cost term which punishes proposed accumulation rate profiles which are highly variable relative to a solution computed with no regularization and smoothed over a moving 600-m depth window. This window size is chosen because it is the smallest interval over which the data can be smoothed given the 200-m bin size of the accumulation rate parameters. 

The regularization term, $r$ is the ratio of the variance of a proposed set of accumulation rates to the variance of the smoothed, non-regularized accumulation rate profile. Values of the regularization term for accepted parameter solutions are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:reg}. The regularization is weighted as $r^6$ when included in the calculation of the age cost (Equation~\ref{eqn:loglikeage}) to sufficiently reduce variability in the accumulation rate profile.

% To estimate $\sigma_{TWTT}$ in Equation~\ref{eqn:loglikeage}...

% \begin{equation}
% \frac{1}{\sigma_{TWTT}}= \frac{\sqrt{k_e/2}}{\sigma_{cost^*}}
% \end{equation}
% Here $k_e$ is the number of degrees of freedom and $cost^*$ represents the perfect model of TWTT which is perturbed with errors consistent with what we expect to find in the radar observations. For simplicity, we assume $k_e$ is the same as the number of reflectors for which we invert.

% \begin{equation}
% cost^*_{TWTT} = \frac{\sum_{j = z}[TWTT_m(z) - \overline{TWTT_m}(z)]^2}{2}
% \end{equation}

\section{Degrees of freedom and parameter correlation}\label{sec:ke}
\counterwithin{figure}{section} %reset figure numbering

As we invert for model parameter values, we anticipate the data points used to constrain our likelihood functions -- sourced from radar observations and a Byrd ice core volcanic chronology -- are not independent of one another. As a result, we expect the number of degrees of freedom to be less than the number of data points available. While we do not know the number of effective degrees of freedom, $k_e$, we explore the sensitivity of our results to our choice of $k_e$ (Figure~\ref{fig:ke}). We find that our choice does not significantly impact the mean estimates of age or depth for our radar reflectors. In lieu of more information about the degrees of freedom, we choose to assume $k_e = \frac{N_{data}}{2} = 30.5$ because convergence on the accumulation rates are strong and the rate at which the algorithm finds solutions is reasonable.

Figure~\ref{fig:flowparamconvergence} shows the results of inverting for several model parameters in this problem, including flow parameters such as $q$ as well as ice property parameters such as $v_{ice}$. The results show the parameters are not correlated with one another and do seem to convergence to most-likely solutions.

Accumulation rate is divided into 10 parameters, each covering a depth bin of $\sim$200 m. This allows for variation in the accumulation rate over time, as expected. The resulting accumulation rate profiles are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:accumdepth}. As discussed previously and further in Appendix~\ref{sec:regularization}, these profiles have been regularized to preferentially select those which do not exhibit unrealistic variability. In Figure~\ref{fig:accumdepth}, they have been additionally sorted by cost to demonstrate the relative quality of the accepted solutions.

\label{fig:accumdepth}
\end{figure*}

To further explore the accumulation rate solutions, we look at the accepted parameter values and their convergence over all iterations. As seen in the right side of Figure~\ref{fig:accumconvergence}, the accumulation rate solutions do not converge as readily as other parameters, leaving wider distributions exhibiting more uncertainty in our estimates of accumulation rate. This may mean that our priors play an important role in estimating the value of accumulation rate and therefore the result could be improved with a more informative prior. This is particularly true at the bottom of the ice column, where neither volcanic chronology data nor radar data is available to constrain the accumulation rate.

We see correlation between some accumulation rate parameters (left side of Figure~\ref{fig:accumconvergence}). This may indicate we could have combined these accumulation rate depth bins. Figure~\ref{fig:accumCorrelation} shows a correlation matrix between pairs of accumulation rate parameters. Along the diagonal are histograms of each accumulation rate parameter. Pairs of accumulation rate parameters to not tend to be very correlated and only one pair of accumulation rate parameters has $R^2 > 0.5$. In general, $R^2$ values are highest between accumulation rates in the lower part of the ice column, where parameter values are more difficult to constrain due to a lack of data and flatter age-depth profile.
