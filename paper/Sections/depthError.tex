\subsection{Radar depth and error}
In addition to constraining the age of englacial reflectors with the Byrd ice core chronology, we also quantify uncertainty in their radar-observed depth, another source of error in the age-depth profile. The ice-penetrating radar used in this analysis was collected in several surveys by the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, including GIMBLE \citep{wais2016}, AGASEA \citep{holt2006}, CASERTZ \citep{morse2002}, and SOAR/WMB \citep{luyendyk2003}. Data has been collected from a DC-3 or Twin Otter airborne platform and uses either the HiCARS coherent radar system with 60 MHz center frequency and 15 MHz bandwidth \citep{peters2005} or the TUD-derived incoherent radar sounder \citep{blankenship2001} with 4 MhZ bandwidth. Radar pulses transmitted into the ice sheet reflect off surfaces of dielectric contrast in the ice that are the result of variations in ice fabric, composition, temperature, rheology, etc \citep{fujita2000}. The reflected signal is received by the radar system and recorded as two-way travel time (TWTT) from transmission to receipt.

In this study, we consider TWTT of four reflectors spanning the ice thickness in the region of central West Antarctica (Figure~\ref{fig:layergram}). These reflectors have been tracked extensively using Halliburton's Landmark seismic interpretation software and can be tied to both the Byrd and WAIS Divide ice cores for dating. %Determining the depth of the reflectors, $D_r$, may be affected by several sources of uncertainty, including uncertainty in the firn depth, the velocity of the radar pulse in ice, and the pulse-limited precision of radar observations.

To estimate reflector depths, $D_r$, we begin with a simple relation relating different velocities of the radar signal in air and in ice. We also incorporate several known sources of uncertainty, including: 1) variations in the signal velocity in ice due to ice temperature and fabric ($\vec{v_{ice}}$), 2) vertical precision limitations of range detection ($\epsilon_{prec}$), and 3) measurement errors in the density profile needed to account for the changing signal velocity in the firn ($d_{firn}$):

\begin{equation}\label{deptheqn}
p(D_r)= \frac{1}{2}[(TWTT_r + \epsilon_{prec,r}) - (TWTT_{surf} + \epsilon_{prec,surf})] \cdot v_{ice} + d_{firn}
\end{equation}

The first uncertain term, $v_{ice}$, results from ice temperature, crystal structure, anisotropy, and other ice fabric effects. It varies from 168 to 169.5 $m/{\mu}s$ \citep{fujita2000} and the integration of these errors leads to increasing depth uncertainty with depth.  The complexity of local ice properties affecting the velocity at any location and depth make it difficult to know the error distribution, so we make the simplifying assumption that this error is uniform. We invert for values of $v_{ice}$ based on a prior uniform distribution: $p(v_{ice}) ~\sim U(168\,m/{\mu}s,169.5\,m/{\mu}s)$. We assume the value of $v_{ice}$ is a constant throughout the ice column and apply it systematically to all reflector depths.

The radar pulse width determines its vertical precision \citep{millar1982}. We assume a finite pulse width, meaning that an infinitesimally thin layer of ice will appear in the survey to have a finite width. This can lead to errors in tracing reflectors and quantifying their depths. We assume a 10 ns precision, consistent with generally high signal-to-noise of expected of prominent reflectors, and assume this error is normal such that $p(\epsilon_{prec}) = N(0,10\,ns)$. Values of $\epsilon_{prec}$ are sampled for each reflector independently.

Finally, in the upper part of the ice sheet, a firn layer exists with variable density. The velocity of the radar signal is reduced in the firn compared to its velocity in solid ice. To deal with this, we use a firn correction to accurately estimate the depth to radar reflectors. All englacial reflectors of interest in this study are deeper than the firn layer, so we systematically apply a firn correction---the difference between the ice thickness with and without the firn layer present---to $D_r$ to correct for the underestimation of depth if the firn layer is not considered. The firn correction, $d_{firn}$, is treated as a model parameter for which we invert. Based on density measurements at the Byrd ice core site \citep{gow1970}, bounds can be placed on the firn layer thickness and therefore the firn correction. We assume the firn correction to be less than the firn layer depth ($\sim$ 65 m at the Byrd ice core site) and sample values from a uniform distribution: $p(d_{firn})\sim$ U(1\,m, 65\,m). %Errors in density, $\rho(z)$, are available for the WAIS Divide measurements. These are assumed gaussian, randomly sampled, and the firn correction is computed using the \citet{dowdeswell2004} relation:

%\begin{equation}
%z_f = \frac{K}{n^{'}_{i}}\int{(\rho_{i} - \rho(z)) dz}
%\end{equation}
%where K is 0.85 m$^{3}$ Mg$^{-1}$ \citep{robin1969}, $n^{'}_{i}$ is the refractive index of ice ($n^{'}_{i}$=1.78), $\rho_{i}$ is the density of ice ($\rho_{i}$=0.917 Mg m$^{-3}$) and $\rho(z)$ is the density of ice at depth \textit{z} with units Mg m$^{-3}$.

We assume constant velocities in air (300 m/${\mu}$s) and ice ($v_{ice}$). The TWTT from the observing aircraft to the surface of the ice sheet is known from interpretation of the surface reflector, $TWTT_{surf}$. The computed depth of each reflector is relative to this surface reflector. Just as each reflector may have TWTT precision errors independent of the others, errors in the distance between the surface and the acquisition aircraft are systematic across all observed reflectors in the ice column. Therefore, a randomly sampled precision error, $\epsilon_{prec,surf}$, is also applied to $TWTT_{surf}$.
