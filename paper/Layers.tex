\begin{abstract}

The Byrd ice core, the first deep ice core drilled in Antarctica, is in a prime position to contribute to studies of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's response to climate change. We use correlation between the Byrd ice core and laterally-extensive ice-penetrating radar to date englacial reflectors throughout the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. However, the Byrd ice core chronology is relatively poor due to limitations in drilling technology a lack of thorough uncertainty analysis. To address this, we construct a Bayesian estimate of age-depth profiles and uncertainty in the deep Byrd ice core chronology. Our result is validated against the recently-drilled WAIS Divide ice core chronology using isochronous englacial layers observed using ice-penetrating radar. We interpolate isochronous surfaces of four ages which sample the ice depth and observe that...

%%Ice-penetrating radar stratigraphy is used to construct isochronous englacial surfaces in central West Antarctica. We estimate uncertainty on the Byrd ice core chronology using a Bayesian MCMC inversion scheme and comparison to the recent WAIS Divide ice core chronology. These two chronologies are used to date englacial isochronous layers traced through Marie Byrd Land and the Thwaites Glacier catchment using seismic imaging software. The resulting englacial surfaces reveal the response of layer geometry to effects such as past ice flow, boundary conditions, and accumulation.

\section{Posterior distribution of Englacial reflector age-depth}\label{byrdchronology}
The Byrd ice core site lacks robust error analysis, so we derive uncertainty bounds for the Byrd ice core by computing the probability distribution of ice sheet parameters constrained by published ice core chronologies. Subsequent correlation to the WAIS Divide ice core is made using isochronous englacial reflectors which have been tracked between the two ice core sites. We assume covariance in age as a function of depth and account for uncertainties in ice flow parameters such as accumulation rate over time to construct a self-consistent distribution of reflector ages.
